A godot addon that adds a new AnimateSymbol node that lets you use and play
Adobe Animate Texture Atlases.

## Features

The current version of this project is unfinished and thus certain features of
texture atlases aren't supported at this time.

This includes:

* Filters
* Blend Modes
* Certain loop modes may not work as intended

Generally 100% playback compatibility is not guaranteed but any reports of atlases
that don't work and even help to get them working is very appreciated!
